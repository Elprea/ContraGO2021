============
CONTRAGO
============


    ContraGO is a unique software application that allows for all types of contractors
    to record measurements of a particular job, materials required for the job, and the
    total cost, to produce a clean and organized document with all the information provided
    filled in. The software helps contractors with various jobs organize all details into one single place.
